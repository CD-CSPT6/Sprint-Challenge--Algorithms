#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The runtime is O(n) because the number of operations this while loop will perform is linear to the given information.


b) This runtime is O(n*log(n)). The for loop would run O(n) and the while loop would e running O(log(n)) due to it doubling while it is less than j and incrementing the sum. 


c) This is O(n) because the steps are relative the the amount of given information.
